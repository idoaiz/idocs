# Idocs

This repository hosts a collection of jupyter-notebooks I wrote about different topics in Python programming.
In most cases, I find some concepts fascinating enough to deep-dive into them - and also write about them to share the knowledge.

Here is a list of what I've written about so far:

## Closure Objects

Inspired by Robert Nystrom's book "Crafting Interpreters", I toyed with the idea of replacing classes in Python by closures.
As it turned out, this was also a journey through functions and closures internals in Python, and a demonstration of the major performance optimizations introduced in Python 3.11.


## Nested Comprehensions

Comprehensions are one of my favorite features in Python, but making nested comprehensions always confused me.
While trying to understand the logic behind the nested comprehension syntax, we also see why it actually makes perfect sense to write them this way.
